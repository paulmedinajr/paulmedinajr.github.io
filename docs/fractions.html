        <h1>Fractional Art Collective of Pol Medina Jr.</h1>
        <p>
          In this one-of-a-kind NFT collection &hellip;<br /><br />Web3 
          and art innovation is at its core &mdash; with something called 
          &quot;fractionalized NFTs&quot;.
        </p>
        <img src="/images/banner-fractional.jpg" />
        <p>
          Led by the team of Ark of Dreams (AoD), together with Sir Pol 
          Medina Jr. (PMJr, of the infamous Pugad Baboy comic series) 
          and the entire PMJr and AoD community, this will be a beautiful 
          experiment of revolutionizing the way people collect, use, and 
          value art, powered by NFT technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's a web3 experiment in &quot;decentralized governance&quot; 
          of art collecting in a way that hasn't been done before, 
          especially here in the Philippines.
        </p>
        <p>
          And just by reading this right now, you have the opportunity 
          to be an important participant of this experiment, and be a 
          part of web3 and art innovation history. 
        </p>

        <h2>What is Happening?</h2>
        <p>
          When the Ark of Dreams team approached Pol Medina Jr. to 
          &quot;immortalize&quot; his physical art pieces into NFTs 
          (digital assets with verifiable ownership in a web3 technology 
          called &quot;blockchain&quot;), he was all in. 
        </p>
        <p>
          He knew that he wouldn't live forever. But by transforming his 
          physical art pieces into NFTs, his art and legacy can be a part 
          of history not just in the hearts and minds of his fans, but 
          also in the generations to come &mdash; forever.
        </p>
        <blockquote>May forever sa blockchain!</blockquote>
        &mdash; Pol Medina Jr.<br /><br />
        <blockquote>
          With the many NFT art pieces coming out in the NFT 
          space, we needed to do something different. The whole goal of 
          transforming Sir Pol's art pieces into NFTs is to immortalize 
          his legacy and help the royalties take care of his family.
        </blockquote>
        &mdash; CEO and co-founder of Ark of Dreams, Chii the &quot;Crypto Queen&quot;.<br /><br />
        <p>That's when the idea of fractionalized ownership was born.</p>
        <p>
          Not only will fractionalization help share PMJr's art to more 
          people than when they were sold to 1 owner for each art piece, 
          it will help art collectors and fans have a piece of his legacy 
          at a very accessible price point.
        </p>

        <h2>Fractionalized NFTs?</h2>

        <p>
          For his first NFT Collection, &quot;Pol Medina Jr.'s Legacy 
          Vault&quot;, 31 of his initial physical art pieces were 
          transformed into a high-resolution digital image (details 
          preserved) and are now part of the &quot;Legacy Vault&quot;. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Fractions of each art piece are ERC-1155 tokens that will 
          allow holders to be part of a collective governance over that 
          specific art piece &mdash; each of which is an important part 
          of PMJr's legacy, and the arts and culture history of the 
          Philippines.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before we go into more details into how this works, it is very 
          important to emphasize that this is a huge experiment in web3. 
          As we go along this journey, we will learn together, win 
          together, and even fail together. 
        </p>
        <p>
          It is also important to note that upon embarking on this 
          experiment, we are all going to be confused together, but at 
          the same time, it will give us the chance to do something 
          really beautiful and magical in the process. 
        </p>
        <p>
          We would love for you to be a part of this experiment with us 
          &mdash; we will do everything together to see this experiment 
          through.
        </p>

        <h2>What Does It Mean To Be a Fractional Owner of PMJr's NFT Art Pieces?</h2>

        <p>
          When you become a fractional owner of one (or more) of the art 
          pieces in this collection, it means:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            You let yourself join what we like to call, &quot;Fractional 
            Art Collective&quot; &mdash; a web3 experiment on decentralized 
            governance of important artworks in history.
          </li>
          <li>
            You get an ERC-1155 token (or fractional NFT) that you can 
            list or sell in Opensea, and other NFT marketplaces that 
            accept ERC-721 and ERC-1155 NFT standards.
          </li>
          <li>
            You get usage rights for personal and commercial use of the 
            NFT/s that you own in this collection. You can use it as your 
            profile picture, a banner on your website, a photo in your 
            commercial press release, or even create a whole NFT project 
            around that NFT's image and story.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you're from a supported country, you can use your fractional 
            NFT as your verified NFT profile picture on Twitter Blue. 
          </li>
          <li>
            You get unlimited access to the iconic artist that is Pol 
            Medina Jr. for anything that you can think of (e.g. 
            consulting, art review, etc.).
          </li>
          <li>
            And a whole lot more benefits listed on The Legacy.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>On the technical side of things, each fractional NFT that you own &hellip;</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Represents a vote (not ownership) in the decentralized 
            governance of that specific art piece;
          </li>
          <li>
            Allows you to be a part of the decision-making pertaining 
            to that specific art piece.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lets you claim a portion of the royalties for that specific 
            art piece, whenever it gets sold or exchanges hands &mdash; in perpetuity.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why Go Through The Trouble of Fractionalization?</h2>

        <p>
          In the art collecting industry, professional art collectors 
          would bid on important art pieces to the millions and billions 
          of dollars. This means that only a handful of people have 
          access to pieces of our arts and culture and how they're used 
          (or even who holds them).
        </p>
        <p>
          With fractionalization, we can get more people to become 
          &quot;professional art collectors&quot; at a portion of the 
          art piece's total value.
        </p>
        

        <p>
          This is not a new concept in the art and NFT world, but a 
          first-of-its-kind here in the Philippines (and maybe even in 
          Southeast Asia). 
        </p>

        <p>
          Who knew you could be an NFT collector as a normal citizen a 
          few years ago? Now you can even become a professional art 
          collector (in the form of fractional NFTs), and get to be a 
          part of shaping the arts and culture scene &mdash; in a 
          decentralized and community-centric faction.
        </p>

        <p>
          You get to support your favorite artists, you also get to 
          reap the benefits in terms of royalties and voting rights to 
          the future of that art, and you can get to name yourself as a 
          professional art collector at the fraction of the price.
        </p>

        <p>Pretty magical to go through all the &quot;trouble&quot;, if you ask me.</p>

        <h2>What Are The Different Scenarios That I Can Vote On?</h2>
        
        <p>
          Here are just a few examples of what you can vote on and what 
          decisions can be made to an art piece:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Can we make a book out of the history of this art piece?</li>
          <li>Should the physical art piece be sold to the highest bidder or donated to a museum?</li>
          <li>Should the Vault Treasury be used to a particular charity, or to fund a movie?</li>
          <li>Should we make a whole new NFT project based off of this art piece?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>There's just unlimited possibilities - the only limit is your imagination.</p>

        <p>By getting a Fractional NFT of PMJr:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>You get to show your support to his art and the things he believes in.</li>
          <li>You get to support the overall arts and culture scene by moving things forward with cutting edge technology.</li>
          <li>You get to vote on what happens to the art piece that you have a fraction of.</li>
          <li>You get to share in the good things that happen to the art piece, including portions of its royalties &mdash; in perpetuity.</li>
          <li>You get to be a part of history as we move innovation forward, not just on flipping NFTs for a quick profit, but on collecting important pieces of physical art in its NFT form that could get lost in real life. </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>LFG I'm In. Wen Fractions?</h2>
        
        <p>
          PMJr's art pieces will be dropped on a weekly basis (as of 
          this writing) starting on March 21, 9:00 PM UTC+9. 
        </p>

        <p>
          This is to give everyone a chance to create a community for 
          each art piece and have time to gain more funds for the next 
          art pieces that will be dropped. PMJr got a lot of fans who 
          like to collect his &quot;books&quot;, and now his book covers 
          in the form of NFTs. 
        </p>

        <p>
          We want to give everyone a chance to mint each of these art 
          pieces and be an important participant in the immortalization 
          of PMJr's legacy.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can mint by being in the whitelist, which will be updated 
          on a daily basis at 6PM UTC+8. So if you complete the easy 
          requirements on the whitelist page and submit your details 
          after 6PM UTC+8, expect to be able to mint on the next day.
        </p>
